Simon and I somehow formed a significant friendship even before we could communicate in the same language. This communication deficite fell decidedly as my fault as he could navigate five languages with proficiency. We met in Spain in a small town called Alcala de Henares in the province of Madrid. 2008 I believe. I moved into a large flat with four other roommates, Simon being one of them. My inability to speak any Spanish made my first four to six months there quite solemn and it wasn't until Simon approached me about a portfolio he wanted to put together that I actually started to feel included. He was a historian, philosopher and just breaking into acting. One day, he inquired about a camera I had -a Canon Rebel XT- and asked if I knew how to use it. I interpreted this as him asking to borrow it which I indicated through gestures as if he were deaf. Eventually through enough gestures, he invited me hiking and told me to bring the camera which I agreed to. Just on the opposite bank of a river running behind our flat was a trail that lead to some Arabic Ruins. When we arrived at the site, he adorned a towel as a toga and took from his backpack a ridiculous plastic sword he'd purchased at a corner store. This he explained, with the help of hand signals, would be part of a portfolio to land work as an extra. That first photo outing fueled many to follow and our collective enthusiasm for cinema climbed agressively skyward.</p></div>
